# IOS-Firebase
This is a quick app for my swift class students to learn how to integrate firebase into their projects.
This app let's you do the following things
- Regster for an account
- Store Username in a table
- Store a hard coded account balance to that table as well
- Pint out the username and account balance once the user is logged in successfully.

Pay attention to the import and declarations in the AppDeligate.swift file
